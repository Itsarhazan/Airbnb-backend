The property is older and there was some remodeling noise for a few hours from the neighboring apartment, which we could hear through what seemed to be a shared skylight, but it was very brief and not a concern (unless noise privacy is a very high priority, which it wasn't for us).  We didn't even use the third bedroom with bunk beds, but it would be ideal for a family.  The metro was close enough, and the bakery just downstairs, together with the grocery store literally across the street, were a wonderful convenience.  We went nearly everywhere by metro, and the location was central enough that at the end of the day, if we were too tired to make our way back by metro, an easy cab ride back to the apartment never exceeded 8 euros (which would've been the cost of the metro for all four of us anyway).

We checked in late at night but Melanie gave us all the information before arrival so we could check in easily on our own. If you once find this place, you will relalise how close it is from Soho, but getting here for the first time wasn't very easy for us. I stayed here with my husband and my brother's family and the place was spacious enough (considering its hongkong) for us all to hang around. You need to walk up to the 4th floor but wasn't a problme at all to us. 
We had some issue about electricity but Melanie responded quickly and helped us sort out the problem. One thing we felt inconvenient was hot shower but we got used to it later. And, it was very considerate of Melanie to prepare three heaters for us. 
I highly recommend this place for a family or groups of 4-5 ppl and especially those who wish to enjoy the atmosphere of Soho area and lankwaifong. I and my husband went out for a drink every night and found awesome bars and restaurants. We could have done it easily as the place is so close to it.

The house is as it's seen on the pictures. It is pretty good size for three people. My parents slept on the bed and I slept on the couch. I am 180 cm (5' 11'') and fit on the couch and it was pretty comfortable.\r
When we arrived Michelle's house she greeted us right away, took her time to explain how to commute, where to eat and what to do in the city. \r
The location of house is pretty good. It takes 20-30 min with metro to Manhattan downtown, depends on which line you use. You can also take the metro from JFK, otherwise the cab costs  around $50. In the house everything was clean and neat. She also provided us towels for shower etc. Besides that, whenever I texted to Michelle she responded in timely manner, which made everything easier.\r

I should mention that her internet is very fast. I don't know what ISP she uses, but it was a joy to go back to a temporary accommodation and know that you are well connected while traveling. I'm not sure of the exact setup, but it appeared that we had a separate modem and router just for us. This was a huge relief.

Michelle is a great  hostess, she helped us with everything and even oferred to keep our lugagge some hours after the check out. \r
The place is perfect, there are groceries, KFC, subway station, and it\xB4s 20-30 mins from downtown Manhattan! \r
Beautiful place, very comfy and cozy, everything was clean. We couldn\xB4t enjoy the backyard because the chill, but it was awesome! and there were some lovely squirrels!

==)positifs: \r
Bon compromis rapport qualit\xE9 / prix. La proximit\xE9 avec une station de m\xE9tro est un plus ainsi que celle de l'\xE9picerie permettant de faire les petites courses pour les repas pris au gite. Michelle est extr\xEAmement accueillante et serviable. \r
l'appartement est simple et tr\xE8s propres. 4 vrai lits confortables. \r
==)n\xE9gatifs:\r
bien que situ\xE9 dans un quartier + calme, la chambre donne sur la rue, et les nuits peuvent \xEAtre difficiles pour les oreilles sensibles. le m\xE9tro qui passe dessous est audible, tout comme les avions. mais \xE0 New York , il est difficile de trouver une endroit tr\xE8s calme. NEW YORK reste un environnement urbain et donc globalement bruyant, autant en avoir conscience. \r
Pour une famille de 4, les lits enfants sont dans la pi\xE8ce qui sert de coin jour. Une table et chaises pliantes n\xE9cessitent d'\xEAtre pli\xE9s  pour installer le 4i\xE8me lit et inversement, plier le lit pour prendre les repas. Pour les fran\xE7ais que nous sommes, la table est aussi importante que le lit. \xE7a peut \xEAtre un probl\xE8me. \r
Peu de vaisselle ( verres en plastique) ce qui est un peu dommage mais \xE7a reste un d\xE9tail.\r
Mais quand on vient \xE0 New York, ce n'est pas pour une ballade gastronomique. Nous recommandons vraiment cette adresse. Tr\xE8s bon compromis.\r
La cours arri\xE8re sera appr\xE9ciable pour les p\xE9riodes + douces.\r
\r
English comments:\r
Just returned from NYC where we stayed with our 2 teenagers in Michelle's appartement. We are really delighted .\r
\r
==)positives:\r
Good compromise quality / price ratio . Proximity to a metro station is a must as well as with the grocery store allowing some errands for meals at the appartement. really practical, opened until 21h. Michelle is extremely friendly and helpful.\r
the appartment is simple but  very clean with 4 real comfortable beds.\r
\r
==)negatives:\r
Although located in a quiet neighborhood, the parent room is overlooking the street, and the nights can be difficult for sensitive ears. Subway is audible,as well as stay & trucks in the street. But to moderate this aspect,  in New York, it's difficult to find a quiet place because it remains a generally noisy urban environment as knowledge.\r
For a family of 4, children beds are in the main room. A table and chairs need to be folded to open beds and vice versa, folding bed for meals. it could be a problem.\r
Very few dishes ( plastic glasses ) which could be improved but it's still a detail.\r
\r
But when we come to visit New York, it is not for gastronomic ballad, and it's important  to find a confortable & clean area. The backyard could be pleasant when the weather allows to use it. Unfortunatelly for us it's was too cold begining of march.\r
We really recommend this address.\r
Many thanks to Michelle.\r

We just spent 5 days in the big apple and we drove in to this Brooklyn location.  The host where incredibly attentive and just wonderful, the apartment spotless, hip & modern and really comfortable. 

Do not be intimidated by the transitioning neighborhood as we encountered that many residents are very friendly and helpful (directions) and this particular street has a real interest in making a real change hence empowering their community.

The subway is a little ways (12 to 15 min.) walk. We would use our vehicle to drive to the subway station (there are two corresponding)  and park nearby to facilitate the to and from.  If you need quick access to the subway at all hours of the day and night this may not be the place for you.

The apt. is an excellent value  for the money (as per  many  manhattan locations offer around  the same nightly  $$ rate but have to share their apt ).

The neighboorhood itself was safe, we had no issues at all, however I\`d prefer staying   in Brooklyn districts closer to Manhattan area next time as  we were travelling to Midtown up to 1h. Being a citizen of the huge city too (Moscow, Russia) , underground is not our favorite place to be  :) \r

The area is a bit out of the main hub of Williamsburg and Bushwick but everything is easily accessible with a short walk or the subway about 8 mins walk away.\r
Alex left me a list of great stores, cafes and restaurants in the immediate area.  \r
Some people may be concerned about the area at face value as it is a white minority but I felt safe at all times.  People seemed friendly.\r

She is respectful of one's privacy but always ready to give support when asked upon. Be it in spoken or written form I always got my answers from her within no times. She also proofed to be very flexible in terms of arrival and departure times which I appreciated a great deal. If you are a fan of jazz music (like I am), make sure to double check ahead of time about her current concert dates so as not to miss your hostess on stage like I did (grumble ;-)).

The room I occupied was the smaller one of two that Isabel rents out. So if her flat is fully rented out there can be a maximum of 4 guests plus your hostess in the flat, which can cause some bathroom jam, especially during the hot and humid summer times, when the need for a cool shower is inherent to everyone's desire. 
My room was as depicted. If you plan on using it for double occupancy, I recommend taking Isa's larger room (unless the two of you are very much in love and want to cuddle up close ;-)). Also, if you need a table for writing, ask for the larger room as well, which comes along with one.
The flat itself is absolutely enchanting and furnished with love and an artistic eye to details. It's location is a dream for touristic explorations with anything within walking distance. 
Therefore, I can easily recommend both Isabel and her flat to anyone wishing to immerge himself into the local customs and get a good doze of what it is like "to live like a true Barcelonian".

It's a 20 minute walk from the beach which is a plus. It's located in a very old building on the top floor, so it is rather stuffy and warm in the apartment. The room overlooks a very narrow street/alley so it's rather dark and it's easy to hear the noise coming from the street and the neighboring apartments. There are a few other rooms in the house that are being rented out, so other people will be staying in the house which makes it a necessity to lock the room when you leave the apartment. 

It's important to note that this place has a very strict check out time. On our last day, we had an evening flight but had to check out in the morning. When we asked if we could check out late, Isa told us to take our stuff to the train station and use the lockers there, but the train station does not have lockers. We ended up renting a locker  at a place called "Barcelona lockers". That, I would say changed all the plans for the last day.

Isabel is a creative, sensitive and respectful person, with an open mind- yet she has the necessary boundaries that are required to organize an environment where so many different people are going to stay and hopefully enjoy. 
The street itself is very lively, but the noises didn't bother me at all as i could easily block them out with earplugs. The location could not have been more sentral, still it's on "the right side" of the Rambla, where you can find more independent shops, restaurants, cafes and bars compared to the same leveled streets towards Raval. It is an old and very charming building, so if you want an minimalistic experience with cold, stainless steel and elevators this is not the place for you! And perhaps you are not the right person for this place either ;) I had to leave earlier due to illness, and was so sorry i couldn't stay throughout the whole month as planned.
